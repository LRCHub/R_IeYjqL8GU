[00:01.51] Ebony and Ivory
[00:11.30] Live together in perfect harmony
[00:17.22] Side by side on my piano keyboard
[00:22.09] Oh Lord, why don't we?
[00:33.09] 
[00:33.56] We all know that people are the same
[00:38.92] Wherever you go
[00:41.83] There's good and bad in everyone
[00:47.05] We learn to live, we learn to give each other
[00:53.30] What we need to survive
[00:55.91] Together alive
[01:02.91] 
[01:00.14] Ebony and Ivory
[01:04.60] Live together in perfect harmony
[01:10.64] Side by side on my piano keyboard
[01:15.73] Oh Lord, why don't we?
[01:26.73] 
[01:35.47] Ebony, Ivory, living in perfect harmony
[01:41.21] Ebony, Ivory, ooh
[01:49.71] 
[01:48.13] We all know that people are the same
[01:53.22] Wherever you go
[01:56.53] There's good and bad in everyone
